I note that I was not restricted in my movements.

Infringement will be an administrative offense.
The Kremlin welcomes any decision that helps save human life.
"""We know how many fires occur, many of them have extremely tragic consequences and cause a public outcry."
"So any life saved justifies such measures,"" Peskov said."
First and foremost the press secretary approves of it as a fire prevention measure, and not as a way to protect neighbors from tobacco smoke.

China is strongly opposed to the US adoption of Taipei legislation
China is strongly opposed to the US adoption of the so-called Taipei legislation, which seriously violates the one-China principle and the principles of the Chinese-US Three Communiqués.
Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said on Friday.
The US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations' approval of the legislation is also a serious breach of international law, the founding principles of international relations and crude interference in internal Chinese affairs, said Ma Xiaoguang.
According to him, Taiwan is a part of China and issues in connection with this are an internal matter for China.
"""We call on the American side to clarify the situation, immediately cease introducing similar negative legislation and immediately cease interfering in the Taiwan issue to avoid further damage to Chinese-US relations as well as peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,"" he said."
China should and will be reunited.
This historic trajectory cannot be stopped by anyone or any force, said Xiaoguang.
TikTok is hiding undesirable videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of its users exceeds 500 million worldwide, 40 percent of which are younger than 18 years old.
Imagine China / Reuters
Chinese social network TikTok is censoring videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence or the forbidden Falun Gong religious group, The Guardian reported.
Documents obtained by the publication, reveal that the owners of TikTok (ByteDance company) with the help of their app are promoting Chinese foreign policy goals overseas.
"Most of the violations concerning Chinese policy fall under ""inciting hatred."""
In every case, TikTok classifies the undesirable posts to fall under the scope of general rules so the social network's actions do not appear to be censorship.
"For example, a ban on criticizing the Chinese socialist system falls under the general ban of ""criticism or attacks on the politics or social rules of any country as well as constitutional monarchies, parliamentary systems and so on ..."""
"A ban on referring to the events of Tiananmen Square or the genocide in Cambodia falls under ""distorting the history of China or other countries."""
"The document also lists 20 forbidden names of ""foreign leaders or politicians"" including North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, US presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Geun-hee, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi."
The document states that banned materials fall under two categories.
Posts in the first category are deleted by the social network administrators and can lead to the user being blocked.
Less severe violations are included in the second category: such posts remain on the site but their circulation is restricted by the TikTok algorithm.
"ByteDance representatives told The Guardian that these rules are out of date and are no longer used: ""Now we use a local approach to moderating as well as drawing on independent local specialists."""
TikTok has no specific restrictions on posts for Russian users, said Rustem Bogdanov, founder of Producer Center.
Producer Center is one of the Russian media companies that officially works with TikTok.
All the advertising materials from Producer Center's bloggers are agreed with the social network's representatives, but user materials can be posted without approval, said Bogdanov.
When asked about whether users could talk about politics or Putin on TikTok, Bogdanov spoke in the affirmative and said that he had seen such posts.
"Roman Zaripov, founder of the Our Digital agency, agreed with Bogdanov: ""The main rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: no posting shocking content, discriminatory rhetoric and so on."""
However, any content disliked by the moderators can fall under these rules, noted Zaripov.
Zapirov's agency is another of TikTok's Russian partners.
According to TikTok, the number of its users exceeds 500 million worldwide, 40 percent of which are younger than 18 years old.
According to its user agreement, only people over 13 years of age can use TikTok.
The social network's administrators verify ages with the aid of artificial intelligence: a neural network analyses faces and determines how old people appear, said Bogdanov.
If the neural network decides that a user is younger, the user may be deleted, he added.
According to RBK, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of the WeWork co-working center.

The Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare released the results of an investigation into the amputation of a child's arm
A Rostov region child had his arm amputated due to an error made by doctors, Vzglad reported, citing the local office of the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare's site.
The 11-year-old boy broke his arm, which was set in plaster at a Zernograd area hospital.
Some point after that, the child developed gangrene and his arm was amputated.
The results of the investigation revealed that errors were made in providing a timely and correct diagnosis as well as in the standard and level of treatment.

Earlier URA.RU reported that the head doctor of the Yuzhnouralsk regional hospital was arrested.
Russians warned over fake phone calls from banks
In Russia there has been an increase in the number of phone calls from swindlers using bank phone numbers.
Kommersant reported this, citing Central Bank information.
In the summer of 2019 the regulator provided telecommunications operators with information about more than 2,500 phone numbers from which clients of various financial organizations were called.
Operators detected 189 cases of number substitution.
Another 218 numbers were blocked, and in 59 cases there were restrictions on the use of financial services.
The deputy head of the Central Bank's information security department Artyom Sychev said that a broad spectrum of Russian banks had encountered phone number substitution.
"He explained that operators do not always respond to Central Bank warnings about fraudulent calls, referring to the lack of such an obligation in the law ""On communication""."
The bank Otkritie, Rosbank and Alfa Bank confirmed the information about the increased number of fraudulent phone calls with number substitution.
The Beeline press service said that some of the information about fraudulent phone calls, provided by the Central Bank, was incorrect: the list included numbers that are actually used by banks to communicate with clients.
Their blocking would cause a breakdown in the organization's work.
Artyom Sychev said that the Central Bank plans to create a database of fraudsters' phone numbers, which an operator will refer to in order to check the number of each call.
He explained that the creation of such a database requires legislative amendments.

In September Roskomnadzor found political advertising in the Google, Facebook and YouTube services.
According to the department's data, it occurred during the Russian elections of 8 December.
The State Duma committee was told of the violations.
Later Google said the company supports responsible political advertising.

Stoltenberg discussed Ukraine's accession to NATO with Zelensky
Secretary-General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky discussed Ukraine's membership of the alliance at the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
The secretary-general spoke of the discussions during his appearance at Columbia University in New York.
Answering a question regarding whether the issue was raised during their meeting, Stoltenberg said that they did actually discuss the question and also stressed that he did not set a time frame for Ukraine's entry.
According to him, any country that wanted to join the North Atlantic alliance had to meet certain requirements dictating concrete standards, RT reported.
Alternative to the NATO path suggested to Zelensky in Crimea
Instead of pursuing NATO accession the president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky should work on establishing good neighborly relations with Russia.
The co-chair of the Assembly of Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea Roman Chegrinets spoke about this on Friday, 27 September.
"""Sir president of Ukraine should not repeat the mistakes of his predecessor, but heed the advice of [US president] Donald Trump, which he listened to with a sour face, and improve relations with the president of Russia,"" Chegrinets told RIA Novosti journalists."
Chegrinets noted that he finds Zelensky to be a good actor, but a bad politician.
In his words, the Ukrainian president will be able to remain in power only if relations improve with Russia.
Earlier on 27 September the NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that he had a conversation with Zelensky on the subject of the country's accession to the alliance.
In his words, for this Ukraine must fulfill certain conditions.
On 5 June Rada deputy Yevgeny Balitsky said that the possible accession of Ukraine to the alliance does not guarantee improved life in the country.
Money is more important than football.
Barcelona is coercing Neymar
Spanish club Barcelona and its former Brazilian football player Neymar are attempting to resolve a financial dispute, which arose after the striker's move to French club Paris Saint-Germain.
The matter almost reached the courts, but the Catalonians offered the player a resolution without the need for the courts' involvement.
Otherwise, they refused to allow his return.
Neymar and his astute father, who is also the Brazilian's agent, contrived an interesting maneuverer: according to the agreement with Barcelona, which the player signed in 2016, he was due to receive 40 million euros.
However, after literally one year, the forward moved to Paris Saint-Germain for a record 222 million euros.
Nonetheless, he received 22 million from the Catalonians and now wants to claim the remaining 18 million.
Moreover, the Brazilian's lawyers insist that the club owes him interest for late payments.
When Neymar's demands became known in the capital of Catalonia, Barcelona filed a counterclaim.
The club insists that the bonus is dependent on the entire contract being fulfilled – from 2016 to 2022.
As such, the club considers that the player is entitled to only one-quarter of the 40 million euros and demands the return of a portion of the first payment.
"But most interestingly, Neymar and Barcelona almost agreed that the ""prodigal"" player would return to Catalonia's fold in summer."
But the agreement collapsed, however, hope remains that the forward will return.
Citing insiders, Sports.ru reports that the club's lawyers informed the player's representatives that if the financial demands are not settled out of court, then the Brazilian's return can be ruled out.
Neymar himself wants so strongly to return that he has asked for guarantees that the Catalonians will buy him back.

Conclusions are drawn on the credibility of the Estonian state based on the composition of the Bank of Estonia's council.
As long as members of the EKRE continue to speak before they think, none of them will be invited to join the council.
"""The Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Eesti Pank cannot go and apologize for the statements made by members of the Supervisory Board,"" Laar said in an interview with Delfi, reported by the ERR information portal."

Meanwhile, the Estonian Reform Party would like to see Jaanus Tamkivi replaced on the council by Andres Sutt.
In response to this, Laar said that the Estonian Reform Party's goal was to receive two seats on the Bank of Estonia's council - so that Andres Sutt joined the board in addition to Jaanus Tamkivi.
On Tuesday, September 24, Riigikogu declined Laar's proposal to invite new members to the Bank of Estonia's council.

How to increase your future pension and not overwork
Pension payments can be made by the Russian Pension Fund as well as by non-state pension funds.
NSPFs are private companies, reports Volgogradskaya pravda.ru.
They work like a deposit: you contribute money, the fund invests it and later returns it to you with interest.
If you are interested in this method, first study the information about NSPFs on the Central Bank of Russia website.
All funds operate under the same rules, which are established by federal laws.
Pension points can be purchased according to the law.
A shortfall in points is determined by how many years in the workforce you are lacking for pension eligibility.
This way suits those who worked unofficially.
Also, it is possible to make a contribution for a relative, for example, a homemaker wife.
Recommendations for those who start thinking about the pension at the start of their working life.
Larger pension payments are awarded to civil servants, doctors, teachers, agricultural workers and people who spent a certain number of years working in the Far North.
So that you don't have to refuse yourself anything when you reach pension age, provide for it in advance.
Purchase real estate, currency, securities, save money in deposits.
Most importantly – constantly raise your financial knowledge.

A group of 15 media representatives were reported to have been granted access to the fourth reactor control room of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant as part of a presentation for a guidebook through the exclusion zone.
According to the RT Telegram channel, the journalists wore special protective gear and were there for less than five minutes, since the ruins of the reactor that was destroyed by the explosion still emit 40 thousand times more radiation than normal.
The disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant occurred the night of April 26, 1986.
12 regions of Ukraine and 23% of Belarus were subject to radiation pollution.
19 regions in Russia were affected.
This July, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky signed an order that led to the creation of a green corridor in Chernobyl, which is open to tourists.
The ban on photography in the exclusion zone has also been lifted.
It had been previously reported that the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant exclusion zone was open to tourists on the Belorussian side.
The tour organizers pointed out that you could receive less radiation from one day in the zone than during an airplane flight.
